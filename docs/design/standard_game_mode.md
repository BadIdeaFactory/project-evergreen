# Standard Game Mode

## Win Conditions

The player wins once they've achieved net zero carbon emissions.

## Loss Conditions

The standard game mode has two loss conditions.

1. If the temperature anomaly exceeds 1.5 degrees celsius. 
2. If the player fails to achieve the win condition by the year 2050.

Those are widely accepted criteria for avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. [[1]](#1)

## Start Time

The standard game mode starts on January 1st, 1988. 

## Game Length

The game starts on January 1st, 1988 and must be completed before January 1st, 2050. That leads to a maximum game length of approximately 6 hours. However, practically, many games will be shorter. The player may win or 
lose before 2050, or they may not play at the normal speed.

```
62 (game years) * 365 (game days per year) = 22630 game days
22630 (game days) * 1 (game days per real seconds) = 22630 real seconds 
22630 real seconds / 60 (real seconds per real minute) / 60 (real minutes per real hour) = ~6 hours.
```
